## Preparations

‘Good tools are prerequisite to the successful execution of a job’. The first thing you should do is to prepare your calligraphy tools. The tools mentioned below are usually available in calligraphy (art) shops or you are able to purchase them online.

### Brush

The most important tool you need is a brush. Depending on the size, weight and type of typefaces, you will need different brushes. For most of beginners, a ‘jian hao’ brush is appropriate.

### Ink Sticks and Ink Stones

Traditionally, an ‘ink stick’ is a solid ink block, which needs to be cumbersomely grinded into ink with water on an ink stone before using it. Nowadays, however, you can buy ready-made ink directly to practise calligraphy.

### Paper

We usually choose Xuan paper (raw Xuan paper) or mao bian paper (bamboo fiber paper) for practice. It is recommended for beginners to choose clipped mao bian paper with grids, which is not only convenient but affordable as well.

### Others

In addition to the main utensils mentioned above, some auxiliary utensils are also necessary, such as felt pads, ink cartridges, paperweights, brush stands and brush washers. These can also be replaced with daily necessities. For example, ink cartridges can be replaced with plates, paperweights can be replaced with stones and brush washers can be replaced with bowls.

Besides, you will need a copybook, so just pick the one you like.

## Before Practice

Next, let’s see how to use these calligraphy tools.

1. Pour some water into the brush washer, so that water can cover the entire bristle. Soak the brush while holding the shaft in the water and stirring it gently until the bristle is well moistened. If the brush has not been opened, remove the cap and soak it in warm water for 5–10 minutes. Note that once the brush has been used, do not put it back on with the cap, as this can damage the bristle. After soaking, take out the brush and gently squeeze the water out of the bristle from top to bottom with your hands.
2. Pour some ink into the cartridge, while you can dilute the ink with a few drops of water.
3. Lay your felt pad on the table, take out a piece of paper, lay it flat and hold it down with a paperweight.

## Start Your Practice

Hook the shaft of the brush with your index and middle fingers. The end of the ring finger nail rests against the shaft of the brush from the other side. The little finger rests on the ring finger. The thumb holds the shaft of the brush near the index finger. Dip the ink and practise on paper following the copybook.

## After Practice

- If there is still ink left in the cartridge, either cover it and leave it for another use, or pour it out. Never pour the remaining ink back into the ink bottle, as this will make the ink more likely to spoil.
- After use, the brush should be rinsed by putting the brush into the brush washer and shaking it back and forth in water to spread the bristle and disperse the ink. Change the water and repeat the process several times until the water in the brush washer is nearly colourless and transparent. It’s not required to rinse the bristle completely. Finally, run your hand over the bristle to gather the bristle into a nib and leave to dry naturally in an airy place.
